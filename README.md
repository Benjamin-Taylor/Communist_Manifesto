1) This IPython Notebook generates a word cloud in the shape of a hammer and sickle from words in the Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx.

2) Change the d=path.dirname("/path/to/file/") to main folder containing your black and white image and change mask=np.array(Image.open(path.join(d, "YOURIMAGE.jpg"))) to your jpg in the main folder. 

3) Change text=open("/path/to/where/your/text/is/.txt").read() to point to your text document.

4) A friend asked me make this wordcloud for him - I am not a communist!
